Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was our client for this project. They wanted us to design a web-based version of the game "Draw It or Lose It", which was initially an Android-only application. The software had to be scalable, efficient, reliable, and offer an intuitive and engaging user experience. It needed to support multiple teams and players and maintain only one instance of the game in memory at any given time. The software also had to be compatible across various devices and operating systems.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing this documentation, the comprehensive evaluation and recommendation sections were executed well. They provide a thorough understanding of different development environments and offer reasoned suggestions for the most effective development tools and systems, taking into consideration cost, market share, and compatibility.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through a design document helped in conceptualizing the software's architecture and structure, which significantly streamlined the coding process. It served as a roadmap, providing a clear view of the system's design, the classes involved, and their interrelationships. This approach helped to preemptively identify potential challenges and considerations such as compatibility and concurrency, which were addressed early on in the design phase.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If given the opportunity to revise a part of the document, the "System Architecture View" section could be expanded upon. Although not required for this specific project, providing a detailed depiction of the system's architecture, including physical components, communication, and storage aspects, would offer a more in-depth understanding of the system's workings.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

User needs were interpreted through the game's requirements as stated by the client. The software was designed to offer an engaging, intuitive user experience, ensuring compatibility across multiple platforms. It's important to consider user needs because ultimately, the success of any software depends on user satisfaction and ease of use. Designing with user needs in mind leads to a more user-friendly interface, potentially leading to higher engagement and retention rates.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The software design was approached through thorough planning and documentation, including defining requirements and constraints. This approach allowed me to visualize the system's structure and helped in predicting potential challenges. In the future, I would maintain this methodical approach and add iterative prototyping and user testing for immediate feedback and validation. This would allow us to refine our design continuously and align it more closely with user needs and expectations.
